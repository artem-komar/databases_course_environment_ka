# Course PostgreSQL environment

This package supplies PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and the course's practice data through Docker Compose. Run
commands from this directory, which contains `compose.yaml`. PostgreSQL and `psql` run only inside Docker.

Start with the complete guide for your computer:

- [Windows setup from zero](docs/setup-windows.md)
- [macOS setup from zero](docs/setup-macos.md)
- [Ubuntu, Debian, or Fedora Docker Desktop setup from zero](docs/setup-linux.md)
- [Connect to the shared course instance](docs/connect-to-instance.md)
- [Connect from Windows with PuTTY](docs/connect-with-putty.md)
- [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu from the terminal](docs/install-docker-ubuntu-cli.md)

Each guide installs Git and Docker Desktop, obtains this standalone package, starts the services, opens the supplied
pgAdmin connection, and checks container `psql` and a host-saved SQL file. Use
[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) when an expected result differs.

See the [practice dataset guide](docs/dataset.md) for the canonical four-table fixture, the separate P7 reporting
and P8 window fixtures, their deliberate edge cases, and an optional P9 `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` sample.

For Practice 2, edit `work/practice-02.sql` and answer the `SELECT`, filtering, ordering, and limiting prompts from
class against `practice.courses`. Run the saved file through `/work` as shown in
[Query and script workflows](docs/query-and-script-workflows.md). Worked examples are separate private TA material.

For the next pair, use [Practices 3–4: Design, Build, and Improve a Library Database](docs/practices-03-04.md).
It includes draw.io instructions, student SQL files, and separate empty/populated recovery checkpoints in the
disposable `library_lab` schema. Before Practice 3, complete its required fresh-volume reset and data verification.
Both sessions use the full 80 minutes for demonstrations and exercises.

For Practices 5–6, check the [fresh-start prerequisite](docs/practices-03-04.md#fresh-start-prerequisite), then open
the separate [Practice 5 tasks](docs/practices-05-06.md#practice-5-tasks) and
[Practice 6 tasks](docs/practices-05-06.md#practice-6-tasks). The automatically run
`sql/migrations/` scripts create separate `library_p5` and `library_p6` schemas on first
database creation. Run these queries in your chosen SQL interface (pgAdmin, DBeaver, or PyCharm), save solutions
and captured output under `work/`, and compare a TA or student solution after each writing period. The first
exercises revisit Practice 4. Each session also
offers two optional SQL exercises for early finishers. Its final 20 minutes remain for Assignment 1 support.

For Practices 7–8, use [Practical PostgreSQL Reporting and Window Functions](docs/practices-07-08.md)
and the separate [SQL guide](docs/practices-07-08-sql-guide.md).
Each has eight tasks: four core and four optional, executed in PostgreSQL. P7 builds calendar metrics and
latest-state reports with FILTER, generate_series and DISTINCT ON; its extensions use EXISTS, STRING_AGG,
weekly buckets and safe ratios. P8 uses all 80 minutes for window aggregates, ranking, top-N and running totals,
with optional LAG, moving average, NTILE and first/last values. The handout explains adding only missing
activity/window migrations to existing databases and recovering an older P7 baseline. Each task's Execute
column names the query steps, required columns and ordering; Explain and save gives concrete cases to trace.
Save queries in `work/practice-07.sql` and `work/practice-08.sql`, with labelled output exports and reasoning
under `work/`. P7 retains its A2 orientation studio;
A2 opens after P8, with the next studio in P9.

The host `work/` directory is shared with pgAdmin as **Course work** and with PostgreSQL as `/work` (read only in
the database container). Save SQL in `work/` using your local editor or SQL interface. Practices 5–6 use the
chosen interface to run each query, as do Practices 7–8. On Linux, grant pgAdmin's container user (UID 5050)
write access to `work/`
before saving from pgAdmin; see [Query and script workflows](docs/query-and-script-workflows.md#share-files-with-pgadmin).

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and choose local ports/passwords before the first startup.
2. Run `docker compose up -d --wait`.
3. Open pgAdmin at `http://localhost:5050` (or your `PGADMIN_PORT`) and sign in with its pgAdmin email/password.
4. Use the pre-registered **Course PostgreSQL** server; enter the separate database password if prompted.

The default database connection is `university` as `student`. pgAdmin's email/password variables are
`PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL` and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`; database authentication uses `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
For the shared VM, the instructor can set `POSTGRES_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` and
`PGADMIN_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` in its `.env` before starting Compose. This publishes the services on the VM's
public interface; change both sample passwords before exposing them. On a personal computer, the default
`127.0.0.1` binding keeps access local.

| What you need to do | Command or route | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| Start and wait | `docker compose up -d --wait` | `db` and `pgadmin` become healthy |
| Check services | `docker compose ps` | Both services show their state |
| Interactive SQL | `docker compose exec db psql -X -U student -d university` | `university=#` prompt |
| One-off identity query | `docker compose exec db psql -X -U student -d university -c "SELECT current_database(), current_user;"` | `university`, `student` |
| Verify fixture | `docker compose exec db psql -X -U student -d university -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM practice.courses;"` | Count `8` |
| Verify fresh practice migrations | `docker compose exec -T db psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U student -d university -f /course/sql/verify-practice-data.sql` | `Practice data ready` |
| Reset practice schema | `docker compose exec -T db psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U student -d university -f /course/sql/reset-practice.sql` | Original `practice` fixture restored |
| Stop services | `docker compose stop` | Volumes remain for the next start |
| Restart services | `docker compose restart` | Services restart; volumes remain |
| Full reset (destructive to service volumes) | `docker compose down -v`, then `docker compose up -d --wait` | Numbered SQL migrations recreate university and P3–8 fixtures; host files remain |

Read [Query and script workflows](docs/query-and-script-workflows.md) for pgAdmin, interactive `psql`, one-off
queries, saved files, expected output, error stopping, and platform-specific shell examples. pgAdmin is the main
course GUI; [DBeaver Community](docs/dbeaver-alternative.md) is an optional locally installed alternative. The
[release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md) distinguishes observed runtime evidence from platform checks that
remain pending.
