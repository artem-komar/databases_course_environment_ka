# Troubleshooting the course environment

Run diagnosis and recovery commands from the `course-environment` directory unless a section says otherwise. Keep
the exact error text and shell status when asking for help. PostgreSQL and `psql` belong inside Docker; installing a
host PostgreSQL package does not repair this environment.

Start with these non-destructive checks:

```text
docker version
docker compose version
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail 100
```

Use `Get-Location` and `$LASTEXITCODE` in PowerShell, or `pwd` and `echo $?` on macOS/Linux, to record the working
directory and status. Never run `docker system prune`, `docker volume prune`, or another machine-wide cleanup for a
course problem.

## Docker is stopped

**Symptom:** `docker version` shows client details followed by “cannot connect to the Docker daemon,” “Docker Desktop
is not running,” or a named-pipe/socket error. Compose cannot start either service.

**Diagnose:** open Docker Desktop and inspect its status. On Linux, also run `docker context show` and
`systemctl --user status docker-desktop --no-pager`.

**Recover:** start Docker Desktop from the application launcher and wait for it to report that Docker is running.
After Docker Desktop has completed its first launch on Linux, you may instead run
`systemctl --user start docker-desktop`. Return to the course directory and run `docker compose up -d --wait`, then
`docker compose ps`.

**Expected:** `docker version` shows both Client and Server sections and both course services become healthy. If the
engine immediately stops again, continue with the virtualization or pending-reboot section.

## Unsupported virtualization or WSL

**Symptom:** Docker Desktop refuses to start. Windows may report `HCS_E_HYPERV_NOT_INSTALLED`,
`ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`, or an unexpected WSL error. A Mac may report an incompatible CPU.

**Diagnose on Windows:** open **Task Manager → Performance → CPU** and confirm **Virtualization: Enabled**. In
administrative PowerShell, run `wsl --version` and `wsl -l -v`. The current Docker requirements call for WSL 2.1.5
or later, supported Windows servicing, 8 GB of RAM, and hardware virtualization.

**Recover on Windows:** run `wsl --update`, or `wsl --install` if it is absent, and complete the requested restart.
Enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V in BIOS/UEFI using the computer maker's instructions. On a VM, the administrator must
enable nested virtualization. Do not guess firmware settings on a managed computer.

**Diagnose on macOS:** run `sysctl kern.hv_support`. A supported Mac prints `kern.hv_support: 1`.

**Recover on macOS:** confirm that the Docker installer matches Apple Silicon or Intel. A result of `0` means this
Mac cannot supply the required Hypervisor framework; use a supported course computer.

**Diagnose on Linux:** confirm that `uname -m` prints `x86_64`, the KVM device is available,
`qemu-system-x86_64 --version` reports QEMU 5.2 or later, and `id -nG` contains `kvm`. Docker Desktop for Linux does
not support arm64 or nested virtualization.

**Recover on Linux:** enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V in firmware with the computer owner's help when `/dev/kvm` is
missing. Install QEMU with `sudo apt install qemu-system-x86` on Ubuntu/Debian or
`sudo dnf install qemu-system-x86` on Fedora. If KVM exists but your user lacks access, run
`sudo usermod -aG kvm "$USER"`, then sign out of the complete desktop session and sign back in. Use a supported
course computer when the architecture is not x86_64 or the machine depends on nested virtualization.

**Expected:** Docker Desktop reaches its running state and `docker version` shows a Server section. Windows and Mac
installer/firmware recoveries remain release-test items until observed on the named hardware.

## Linux Docker Desktop context or socket is wrong

**Symptom:** Docker Desktop is open, but a command targets `/var/run/docker.sock`, reports permission denied, uses
unexpected images or volumes, or cannot connect through the `default` context.

**Diagnose:** run `docker context show` and
`env | grep -E '^DOCKER_(HOST|CONTEXT)='`. Docker Desktop should supply and select `desktop-linux`; `DOCKER_HOST` or
`DOCKER_CONTEXT` can override that selection. Its socket is per-user, so a `/var/run/docker.sock` error usually means
the CLI is still targeting a host Docker Engine.

**Recover:** keep Docker Desktop running. Run `unset DOCKER_HOST DOCKER_CONTEXT`, remove any stale exports from your
shell startup file, then run `docker context use desktop-linux`. Do not use `sudo docker`, add yourself to the
`docker` group, change socket permissions, or delete the existing Engine's images and volumes. If `desktop-linux` is
absent, return to the [Linux Desktop launch action](setup-linux.md#configure-access-and-start-the-course-package).

**Expected:** `docker context show` prints `desktop-linux`, and `docker version` works without `sudo` and shows both
Client and Server sections. Desktop images and volumes remain separate from data owned by an existing host Engine.

## A reboot or sign-out is still pending

**Symptom:** WSL, Docker, or Git was installed, but a new terminal still sees the old state. Docker may show WSL or
hypervisor errors immediately after Windows features were enabled. Linux still lacks new group membership.

**Diagnose:** note whether the installer or `wsl --install` requested a restart. On Linux, compare `id -nG` in the
current terminal after adding the user to `kvm`.

**Recover:** save work. Restart Windows after WSL, Windows-feature, hypervisor, or Docker requests. On Linux, sign
out of the complete desktop session and sign back in after changing KVM access; opening another terminal is
insufficient. Reopen Docker Desktop and wait for it to report that Docker is running.

**Expected:** `Get-Command docker` or `command -v docker` finds the CLI, and `docker version` shows Client and Server.

## Failed clone or no release URL

**Symptom:** `git clone` says repository not found, authentication failed, host could not be resolved, or the text
`<repository-url>` appears in the error.

**Diagnose:** confirm that the course release announcement now contains a real repository URL and that you copied
the complete URL in place of `<repository-url>`, including removing its brackets. Run `git --version` separately.
Do not invent a URL from the course name.

**Recover:** reconnect to the network, sign in through the method named in the release announcement, and retry into
a parent directory that does not already contain `course-environment`. If no remote has been announced, use the
instructor-provided downloaded `course-environment` folder. A clean published-clone rehearsal remains a release gate.

**Expected:** the package directory contains `compose.yaml`, `.env.example`, `sql`, `pgadmin`, and `work`. If clone
failed after creating an incomplete folder, keep the error for support and choose a different empty destination for
the retry rather than deleting unrelated files.

## A host port is occupied

**Symptom:** startup reports “port is already allocated,” “address already in use,” or a bind error for `5432` or
`5050`. One service may be running while the other failed.

**Diagnose:** run `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs --tail 100`. On Windows, **Resource Monitor → Network
→ Listening Ports** can identify the process. On macOS/Linux, `lsof -nP -iTCP:5432 -sTCP:LISTEN` and the same command
with `5050` show listeners when permitted. Do not terminate an unfamiliar process.

**Recover:** stop only this Compose project without deleting its volumes:

```text
docker compose down
```

Edit `.env`. Change `POSTGRES_PORT=5432` to an unused high port such as `15432`, or change
`PGADMIN_PORT=5050` to an unused port such as `15050`, matching the error. Then run:

```text
docker compose up -d --wait
docker compose ps
```

**Expected:** both services are healthy. Open pgAdmin with the new `PGADMIN_PORT`; DBeaver must use the new
`POSTGRES_PORT`. The Compose file still binds both ports to `127.0.0.1`.

## Changed `.env` credentials with an existing volume

**Symptom:** `.env` contains a new database or pgAdmin password, but the existing service rejects it. PostgreSQL and
pgAdmin use their initialization values when their named volumes are first created; editing `.env` later does not
rewrite stored accounts.

**Diagnose:** decide whether you need the database changes and pgAdmin settings already stored in this Compose
project. Check that you did not merely exchange `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`.

**Recover while preserving state:** restore the previous values in `.env`, then run `docker compose up -d --wait`.

**Recover by deliberate reset:** only if you accept losing this course project's database changes and pgAdmin
settings, run:

```text
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --wait
```

This removes only the two named volumes belonging to this Compose project. Host files under `work` remain. Do not
use a machine-wide volume or system prune.

**Expected:** log in with the values used for the recreated volumes and rerun the identity query. A full reset is
destructive to container-held course state and cannot restore unsaved database changes.

## Git or Docker is missing from PATH

**Symptom:** PowerShell says a command is not recognized, or `command -v git` / `command -v docker` prints nothing.

**Diagnose:** open a completely new terminal after installation. On Windows use `Get-Command git` and
`Get-Command docker`; on macOS/Linux use `command -v git` and `command -v docker`.

**Recover:** for Git, rerun the OS guide's supported installer or package-manager action. For Docker Desktop, install
the downloaded Desktop package from the matching OS guide, start the application, and complete its CLI setup; then
reopen the terminal. The Docker Desktop package supplies or resolves the required CLI and Compose dependencies. Do
not substitute a standalone Docker Engine installation or install a package named `postgresql` or `psql`.

**Expected:** Git prints a version, Docker shows Client and Server, and `docker compose version` identifies Compose
v2. A Docker CLI path alone does not prove the engine is running.

## Wrong database, user, or password

**Symptom:** pgAdmin, DBeaver, or `psql` reports password authentication failed, a database does not exist, or the
identity query returns an unexpected name.

**Diagnose:** compare the client fields with `.env` and the fixed course identity:

- pgAdmin web sign-in: `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL` and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`;
- database connection: database `university`, user `student`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`;
- DBeaver host: `localhost` and `POSTGRES_PORT`;
- pgAdmin's pre-registered internal host: `db` and port `5432`.

**Recover:** correct only the client field that differs. If `.env` was changed after first startup, use the
[stale-credentials recovery](#changed-env-credentials-with-an-existing-volume). Do not change the supplied
`servers.json` or install local PostgreSQL tools.

**Expected:** this query returns exactly `university | student`:

```sql
SELECT current_database() AS database_name, current_user AS user_name;
```

## Course PostgreSQL registration is missing or deleted

**Symptom:** pgAdmin opens, but **Course → Course PostgreSQL** is absent because its registration was deleted or was
not loaded. Restarting pgAdmin does not recreate a registration that a learner deleted.

**Recover without resetting anything:** on pgAdmin's **Welcome** page, select the **Add New Server** quick link;
it opens the **Register - Server** form. You can also right-click **Servers** in the Browser tree and choose
**Register → Server…**. On **General**, enter **Name** `Course PostgreSQL` and, if you want the same organization,
set **Server group** to `Course`. On **Connection**, enter **Host name/address** `db`, **Port** `5432`,
**Maintenance database** `university`, **Username** `student`, and the database `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from `.env`;
save the registration. The host is `db`, not `localhost`, because this registration connects from the pgAdmin
container across the Compose network. Then expand **Course → Course PostgreSQL → Databases**, open
**university → Query Tool**, and run:

```sql
SELECT current_database() AS database_name, current_user AS user_name;
```

**Expected:** the query returns `university | student`. This creates only one pgAdmin registration. It preserves the
PostgreSQL database, other pgAdmin preferences, and host files under `work`; do not use `docker compose down -v` for
this case.

## Wrong working directory

**Symptom:** Compose reports that no configuration file was found, or a relative file such as `.env.example` or
`work/verify.sql` is missing.

**Diagnose:** PowerShell: run `Get-Location`. macOS/Linux: run `pwd`. The current directory must be the package
directory containing `compose.yaml`.

**Recover:** use `Set-Location 'full\path\to\course-environment'` in PowerShell or
`cd '/full/path/to/course-environment'` on macOS/Linux. Quote a path that contains spaces. Then run
`docker compose ps` again.

**Expected:** Compose can find `compose.yaml` after you enter the package directory.

## A script was saved as `.sql.txt`

**Symptom:** the editor shows `practice-02.sql`, but Docker reports `/work/practice-02.sql` does not exist. Windows
may be hiding known filename extensions.

**Diagnose:** use the file manager to inspect the filename and extension in the package's `work` folder.

**Recover on Windows:** in File Explorer choose **View → Show → File name extensions**, then rename the file so its
complete name ends once with `.sql`. Confirm the rename warning. On macOS/Linux, rename the exact file, for example
`mv work/practice-02.sql.txt work/practice-02.sql`.

**Expected:** the file manager shows the exact name `practice-02.sql`, and the container command uses
`-f /work/practice-02.sql`.

## Missing or unreadable bind-mounted SQL

**Symptom:** `psql` reports that `/work/<name>.sql` does not exist or cannot be opened, or a service log reports
permission denied for a supplied bind mount.

**Diagnose:** first confirm in the file manager that the host file has the expected name in the package's `work`
folder and ordinary read permissions.

**Recover:** save the file under the package's host `work` directory and make the names match exactly, including
letter case on Linux. Keep the checkout in a local folder under your home directory that Docker Desktop can share;
avoid a network share, remote mount, or removable drive for the first run. If Docker Desktop displays a file-sharing
prompt, allow the checkout folder. On Linux, grant your user ordinary read access to the specific file; do not make
the whole home directory world-writable and do not apply Engine-specific SELinux relabel commands. If a failed first
startup left the fixture missing after sharing is repaired, use the
[scoped Linux seed recovery](setup-linux.md#linux-clone-configure-and-start).

**Expected:** this pattern exits `0`:

```text
docker compose exec db psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U student -d university -f /work/<name>.sql
```

Creating a file after the containers start does not require a restart; save it and rerun the command. The mount is
read-only in PostgreSQL; edit files on the host or in pgAdmin's **Course work** shared storage.

## pgAdmin cannot save to Course work

**Symptom:** pgAdmin can open a file under **Course work** but cannot save or upload there.

**Diagnose:** confirm the host folder is `course-environment/work/` and the pgAdmin service has a `./work:/work`
mount in `compose.yaml`. On Linux Docker Engine, pgAdmin's container user has UID 5050.

**Recover:** follow [Share files with pgAdmin](query-and-script-workflows.md#share-files-with-pgadmin) to grant
that UID write access while keeping your own account able to edit the files. On Docker Desktop, move the checkout
to a locally shared folder if it currently lives on a network or removable drive.

## P7–8 lab tables are missing or have old fixture counts

**Symptom:** a task reports `relation "activity_lab.registration_events" does not exist` or
`relation "reporting_lab.results" does not exist`, or the handout's readiness counts do not match.

**Diagnose:** confirm that your SQL connection uses database `university` and that your local package
contains migrations 40 and 50. Run the schema-presence and count queries in
[Prepare the fixture](practices-07-08.md#prepare-the-fixture). A running database volume does not replay
new or edited migration files after `docker compose restart`.

**Recover:** if a lab schema is missing, run only its installation command from the handout: 40 for
reporting_lab, 50 for activity_lab. If the schema already exists with an older baseline, save any edits
in both labs before using the handout's scoped P7–8 checkpoint. That checkpoint replaces both lab schemas;
it preserves earlier practice schemas, storage_lab and host files. Coordinate recovery on a shared instance
with the TA instead of resetting a shared fixture yourself.

**Expected:** activity_lab contains 7 students, 4 workshops, 10 registrations and 18 events;
reporting_lab.results contains 14 rows. The newer P7 fixture includes an active registration with only
August history. Do not rerun an already installed CREATE SCHEMA migration as an update command.

## Verification status

The local candidate's macOS Intel rehearsal observed Docker stop/start recovery with database and pgAdmin state
preserved. It also observed a space-containing clean local clone, stop-on-error behavior, and occupied-port recovery
by changing project ports. The canonical evidence and remaining gates are in the
[release checklist](release-checklist.md#task-6-local-release-candidate-verification).

Windows/WSL, macOS fresh installation, macOS Apple Silicon, native Docker Desktop on Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora, Linux
KVM/context/file sharing, DBeaver GUI/driver, and novice recovery walkthroughs remain unverified release checks. The
course release must not convert these instructions into claims until the named platform and exact version have been
observed.
