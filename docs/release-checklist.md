# Release Checklist

## Current Practices 7–8 package

The learner package now includes [Practical PostgreSQL Reporting and Window Functions](practices-07-08.md),
the separate [SQL guide](practices-07-08-sql-guide.md),
prompt-only `work/practice-07.sql` and `work/practice-08.sql`, and their numbered fixtures and scoped checkpoint.
Both practices have eight tasks: four core and four optional. The Execute columns specify the query steps,
output columns and ordering; Explain and save specifies the cases and reasoning to retain with each result.
Reference answers and private rehearsal evidence remain outside the learner repository.

The instructor's **2026-10-06** isolated PostgreSQL 18.6 rehearsal executed all sixteen P7–8 reference
queries and all twelve existing P5–6 answer queries. It checked the current P7 baseline of 7 students,
4 workshops, 10 registrations and 18 events, and the P8 baseline of 14 results. Report checks covered
UTC period boundaries, quiet days, all-history snapshots, event ratios, ties, NULLs and window frames.
The scoped P7–8 checkpoint preserved earlier/storage edits; resetting the canonical practice schema
preserved both lab fixtures and constraints. The P9 scan baseline was rehearsed separately from the
P7 reporting tasks in the same isolated database.

These SQL checks do not replace the historical GUI and platform evidence below. Native platform setup,
timed novice delivery and a student-accessible published clone remain pending where previously recorded.
For the current documentation revision, check local links, task numbering, fixture counts and Markdown
formatting before packaging. Do not copy private solution files into the learner package.

## Container image evidence

Manifest inspection date: **2026-09-12**.

The release candidates were inspected directly with `docker buildx imagetools inspect`. Both tags were available,
so no replacement version was needed. Compose pins the multi-platform image-index digest so Docker selects the
matching native architecture without a forced platform.

Manifest presence is registry evidence, not a native runtime test. The runtime rehearsal below records the actual
host and engine architectures used; native arm64 startup remains a separate release acceptance check until observed.

## Runtime rehearsal evidence

Observed at **2026-09-12T10:36:57Z** on macOS/Darwin 25.6.0 x86_64, with Docker Desktop 4.55.0,
Docker client 29.1.3 (`darwin/amd64`), Docker engine 29.1.3 (`linux/amd64`), and Docker Compose
v2.40.3-desktop.1. The pulled PostgreSQL image ID was
`sha256:a6638641707cdf047e5d5c2781f437e2e809323cab22c70b280be8389fbb7878`; the pulled pgAdmin image ID was
`sha256:78bcd13ffb0a9a6dff344f4c4a212e3b7622cf1a5a83566c79e550b2ab561487`.

The isolated Compose project `kse-practices-01-02-task1-check` used unused host ports 55432 and 55050 and its own
named volumes. Observed results:

- `docker compose up -d --wait` completed with both health checks passing.
- Container psql returned `university|student`, search path `practice, public`, and the exact eight canonical rows.
- pgAdmin returned HTTP 200 with `PING`; its configuration database contained the expected **Course PostgreSQL**
  registration, including `db:5432`, database `university`, user `student`, and SSL mode `prefer`.
- A PostgreSQL-driver connection from inside the pgAdmin container authenticated to `db:5432` as `student` and
  returned database `university`. Task 6 adds the browser interaction evidence below.
- A changed practice row and the pgAdmin registration survived `docker compose stop` followed by startup.
- The stop-on-error reset returned exit 0, restored all eight canonical rows and the original `Databases` title,
  preserved a guard table in `public`, and left both host SQL files byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Project teardown returned exit 0. No containers or volumes with the verification project label remained.

pgAdmin 9.17 validates login addresses and rejects the required classroom-only `.local` domain by default. Compose
therefore sets its supported `PGADMIN_CONFIG_ALLOW_SPECIAL_EMAIL_DOMAINS` option to `['local']`; an isolated startup
first reproduced the rejection, then verified the override with a running container and successful ping.

Cross-platform, native arm64 runtime, installer, novice, disconnected-network, and published-clone checks remain
release gates and must not be marked complete without observed evidence.

## Task 6 local release-candidate verification

Observed at **2026-09-12T17:02:26Z** on macOS 26.6.2 (Darwin 25.6.0) on an Intel x86_64 host, using
Docker Desktop 4.55.0, Docker client/engine 29.1.3, Compose v2.40.3-desktop.1, Git 2.50.1, uv 0.12.9,
CPython 3.14.7, Playwright 1.62.0, and Google Chrome. The separate checker project is
`/private/tmp/course-release-check`; it is not part of this learner package.

The **`local-rc-2026-09-12`** Git tag is the historical full-runtime and clean-local-clone baseline; its exact
commit is recorded in the private Task 6 verification report. **`local-rc-2026-09-13`** is the finalized local
documentation-fix tag, created after the scoped PASS. It records the reviewed documentation changes and focused
follow-up checks; it does not replace the broader baseline runtime/clone evidence. Both tags belong to the local
`course-environment` repository. The parent course workspace is not a Git repository. Neither local tag is a
published release or satisfies the remote-publication gate.

### 2026-09-13 Docker Desktop Linux documentation revision

The active Linux setup and troubleshooting guides now use Docker Desktop for supported x86_64 Ubuntu, Debian, and
Fedora systems. This documentation revision does not alter the dated runtime, clean-clone, or synthetic-seed evidence
below and does not claim a native Linux test. Native Linux Desktop installation, KVM access, the `desktop-linux`
context, and host-file sharing remain pending platform checks. Docker Desktop for Linux does not support Linux arm64;
students on that platform use a supported course computer. macOS Apple Silicon remains a separate supported but
untested route.

### Acceptance record

<!-- rumdl-disable MD013 -->

| # | Acceptance check | Status | Observed result and remaining gate |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clean clone/startup on Windows, macOS, named Linux | Partial | The source package passed isolated startup on this macOS/amd64 host. A clean local clone is recorded separately below after repository assembly. Windows, Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora installer/runtime checks remain pending. |
| 2 | amd64 and arm64 availability/runtime | Partial | Registry manifests contain Linux amd64 and arm64 variants for both pinned image indexes. Native Linux/amd64 ran here; native arm64 runtime remains pending. |
| 3 | pgAdmin login, registration, connection, restart persistence | Observed on this host | Chrome signed in as `student@course.local`, showed `Course PostgreSQL`, prompted for the database password, connected to `university`, and reconnected after Compose stop/start without registration. Both pgAdmin health probes became healthy. |
| 4 | Equal pgAdmin/psql results and saved mount | Observed on this host | Browser Query Tool and container psql both returned `university | student`; both observed eight rows and IDs `101,102,103,104,105,201,202,301`. `/work/verify.sql` exited 0 through the read-only mount. |
| 5 | Spaces, editor save, PowerShell path | Partial | The tracked UTF-8 scripts ran from the macOS source path containing `KSE/Databases`. The clean local clone uses a path with spaces. A documented Windows editor/PowerShell execution remains pending. |
| 6 | Intentional failure | Observed on this host | A temporary two-statement script failed on the missing table with psql exit 3; the sentinel was absent. |
| 7 | Practice reset and stop/start | Observed on this host | A course-title edit survived stop/start. Reset restored eight exact seed rows and course 101 title `Databases`, kept a `public` guard row, and left the four shipped SQL/work files byte-for-byte unchanged. |
| 8 | Setup blocker diagnosis/recovery | Partial | A second project reproduced `Bind for 127.0.0.1:55433 failed: port is already allocated`; changing its two host ports recovered both services to healthy. Remaining Docker-stopped, missing-PATH, wrong-password, missing-file, and SELinux/bind-mount fault exercises are documented but not all executed on this host. |
| 9 | Offline/pre-pull path | Partial | `docker compose pull` completed, then a new project reached both health checks with `docker compose up -d --pull never --wait`. No host/daemon network was disabled, so a real disconnected-network run and native arm64 pre-pull remain pending. |
| 10 | Timed novice walkthrough | Pending | No novice participant was available. No checkpoint time, helper load, individual completion, or Practice 2 fit is claimed. Use the record in the private TA guide before release. |
| 11 | Published URL/revision and public clone | Pending | No destination remote or access policy was supplied and publication was not authorized. A student-accessible published clone remains required. |

### 2026-09-13 documentation-fix follow-up

The controller performed focused checks in an isolated project for the new documentation paths:

- A host-created UTF-8 `work/my-first-query.sql` ran through
  `docker compose exec -T db psql -X -U student -d university -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f /work/my-first-query.sql` and
  printed `Saved on my laptop`. Editing and saving that same host file, then rerunning the same command, printed
  `Edited on my laptop`. The unchanged `work/verify.sql` returned `university | student`, count `8`, and the eight
  canonical IDs.
- A synthetic failed initial seed left the database container at exit `3` after `CREATE DATABASE`; the enclosing
  `docker compose up --wait` command exited `1`. After the seed file was restored and the project restarted,
  `to_regclass('practice.courses')` was `NULL`, confirming that restart alone did not reseed it. The documented
  scoped reset plus `verify.sql` restored all eight rows and preserved `public.recovery_guard = 'preserved'`.

- Browser recovery removed the registration, confirmed removal, and used **Welcome → Add New Server** to open
  **Register - Server**. It saved **Name** `Course PostgreSQL`, **Server group** `Course`, and the documented
  `db:5432` / `university` / `student` database fields without a service or volume reset. A fresh browser login then
  prompted for the database password; Query Tool returned `university | student`, count `8`, and all eight canonical
  IDs. The registration probe and recovery-query checks each exited `0`.

Both temporary focused-test projects were removed with project-scoped `down --volumes --remove-orphans`, each
returning `0`. The normal `course-postgresql` `db` and `pgadmin` services remained healthy on ports `5432` and `5050`.

These focused checks do not test native Fedora/SELinux or actual Windows, macOS, or Linux editor GUI routes.

The [login](images/pgadmin-login.png), [preloaded server](images/pgadmin-preloaded-server.png), and
[Query Tool result](images/pgadmin-query-result.png) are real captures from this pgAdmin 9.17 rehearsal.

### Tested pre-pull path

Run this while connected to the internet and from the package root:

```sh
docker compose pull
```

Confirm the locally selected image architecture and ID:

```sh
docker image inspect postgres:18.6@sha256:4ef4dbc939d61acea57712655ddb4b4ab27419c913f94cca0cd57cb3ea3c2280 \
  --format '{{.Id}} {{.Os}}/{{.Architecture}} {{.Size}}'
docker image inspect dpage/pgadmin4:9.17@sha256:2f4ce946ddf8360680d7eff4eaba1d91859eb6b4003e6623bad5c63a322c2f4d \
  --format '{{.Id}} {{.Os}}/{{.Architecture}} {{.Size}}'
```

This host reported PostgreSQL image ID `sha256:a6638641707cdf047e5d5c2781f437e2e809323cab22c70b280be8389fbb7878`,
`linux/amd64`, 456,470,914 bytes, and pgAdmin image ID
`sha256:78bcd13ffb0a9a6dff344f4c4a212e3b7622cf1a5a83566c79e550b2ab561487`,
`linux/amd64`, 528,550,678 bytes. After the pull, this check forbids another pull:

```sh
docker compose up -d --pull never --wait
```

It passed in a new isolated project on this host. The selected pre-pull route creates no archive, so there is no
archive filename, checksum, or `docker image load` command to publish. If the instructor later chooses archive
distribution, produce and test separate amd64 and arm64 archives; do not infer architecture from a filename or
claim that loading a tag recreates digest resolution without a real load/start test.

### Clean local clone rehearsal

Local source commit `49111c2` was cloned to
`/private/tmp/course-release-check/Course Environment Clean Clone`, a path containing spaces. With isolated ports
55436/55054, startup reached both health checks. Interactive psql showed database `university`, user `student`,
and table `practice.courses`; the one-off identity query matched; `/work/verify.sql` returned count 8 and all
eight IDs; and the prompt-only `/work/practice-02.sql` exited 0. A fresh pgAdmin volume showed the preloaded server,
accepted the database password, and returned the matching identity, count, and IDs. `docker compose stop` shut down
both services, the clone stayed clean apart from ignored `.env`, and project-scoped volume cleanup succeeded.

This verifies a clean **local** clone of the package content. It does not satisfy acceptance check 11, which requires
the instructor-authorized, student-accessible published URL and release revision.

### Package and publication gates

The current standalone repository includes learner guides, three observed pgAdmin screenshots,
`work/verify.sql`, practice starters through P8, numbered SQL fixtures and documented recovery checkpoints.
Its ignore rules exclude local `.env` and untracked learner work. The private TA guides, reference answers
and parent course documents are outside the repository. The dated Task 6 clone rehearsal above used its
historical package revision; it does not establish a published clone of the current P7–8 additions.

Before publication, the instructor must provide the destination URL and access policy, authorize publication,
publish the actual URL in the release announcement, and test the real URL and released revision as a
student. Windows, macOS Apple Silicon, native Docker Desktop on the named Linux distributions, Linux
KVM/context/file sharing, actual disconnected-network, novice, and published-clone evidence remain release gates.
